I wanted a script to show a random quote from bash.org in every new terminal session. PHP is my language of choice. :)

Requirements: A shell environment, php command line interpreter and url's allowed with fopen().

Installation: Download somehwere in your path, chmod +x

Usage: bashquote [-p provider] [-f] [-h]

Providers:
bash (default) - [bash.org](http://bash.org)
qdb - [qdb.us](http://qdb.us/)
ingdal - [bash.ingdal.net](http://bash.ingdal.net)
